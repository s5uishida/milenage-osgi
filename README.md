# milenage-osgi
This repository contains the MANIFEST.MF file of **the Eclipse plug-in project** for building OSGi bundle from the [Milenage for Java](https://github.com/brake/milenage) and the built bundle file. You need Java 8 or higher.

I would like to thank the authors of this very useful Milenage for Java code, and all the contributors.
